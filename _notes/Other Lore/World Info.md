# World Info
_Ambition gives time, time gives ambition. Those are your gifts, take what else you want._

_Keep moving, keep wanting, keep working._

_Always._

_The march of progress is relentless and if you don't keep pace you'll fall to the dark jester._

_Spearhead the charge and you will be immortal._

### Time and Ambition
These words have been with you since birth. That you must work tirelessly to accomplish great things, and to please the gods, so they let you live. Because in Maschiz, your ambition is directly correlated to your life expectancy, with the lazy dying of age in their twenties while the ones that work hard towards their vision, no matter how noble or heinous, seemingly never age once theyâ€™ve reached adulthood. 

This of course shapes society to favour risky high reward career choices and everything is competitive. A baker doesn't have the business idea "I'll sell enough bread to feed my family". The baker might have the ambition to perfect rye bread and start a bakery empire with dozens of stores working beneath him. This is the main reason why Maschiz is more technologically advanced than any other part of the world. Nobody is satisfied, a plough can be made better, a bow becomes obsolete as gunpowder is harnessed, and the inventions of yesterday are left behind as quickly as possible.
