#### Description:
The country we're in. The different provinces are in red, green and purple. We started the campaign along the north coast in [[Alánor]] (red). The other 2 provinces are [[Quetzhuatl]] and [[Izqatwahl]].

The island is transitioning from navigating safe trails through the jungle between towns to laying down railroad tracks. Bandits, dinosaurs, elementals, poisonous critters and the cripplingly slow pace of travel are all great reasons to invest in that project. In central Maschiz there is the [[amethyst spring]], a large lake surrounded by mountains that is a site of pilgrimage for the god of ambition. The mountain range is called [[The Maw]], owing to the appearance of the range from above. This is also where the elementals that roam the forests originate from, and while they usually follow the rule of bees, they quickly turn aggressive when they sense magic users…

##### The Sinkholes:
Around the island are these gaping holes into the ground, hundreds of feet deep, and leading to a network of water filled tunnels. Most of this is uncharted terrain and they have a reputation for getting divers lost and containing something evil down there. But people still go down, most for fishing but some to seek the treasures of bandit lords and corrupt officials said to be hidden deep in the caverns.
