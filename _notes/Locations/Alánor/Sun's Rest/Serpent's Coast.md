Title: serpent's coast
---
#### Description:
It's a sand beach that streches for about 20-30m before the jungle starts taking over. On the beach is a bunch of seashells and a few coconut crabs. In the morning one can hear some birdsong, and insects chittering from whithin the trees.
It's about one days walk away from [[Sun's Rest]], and is located in the province of [[Al√°nor]].


#### History:
Seprent's coast was an old trading hub from before [[Sun's Rest]] was built, although nowadays it's basically only used for emergencies or if you're trying to evade attention. It's known spot for criminals, but it's not a highly trafficed bandit port.
There are also quite a lot of snakes here (refer to the name)
