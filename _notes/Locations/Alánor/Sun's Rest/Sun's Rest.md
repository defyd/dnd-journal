Title: Sun's Rest
---
#### Description:
The largest city in [[Al√°nor]], and the city we start in. Being built around a large harbour, this is where you find the most foreign traders, tourists and con artists to service these tourists.
The main harbour has Sun Bridge, which is a sectioned off area for personnel ships and political delegations and similar things. This place has much higher cleanliness standards, adorned with idols, art, shops and fancy restaurants.
The rest of the harbour is a much greasier affair, where regular traders haggle, fish are gutted and pockets are picked. The worst stench comes from the far eastern corner where fish hide is tanned into leather, lovingly named __Rat's Ass__.
#### History:
Being one of the first cities, city planning, at least in the old parts is almost non-existent, with winding paths, buildings crammed in wherever they fit, and wind chimes and traders fill the air with noise.
