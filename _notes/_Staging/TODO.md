# STUFF TODO IN THE NOTES

[[Session 1]]: specify why we didn't pay harbour fine, and that we didn't actually steal the boat (think that says in [[Gui-apa]]) as well.
^ Nobody told us about the fine, and we weren't the one steering the boat either. The people were apparentally pirates.
the [[Sunken Ship]] had been down for a few days.

clear up ending of [[Session 1]] better. We sailed away from the shipwreck and anchored in a river outsitde the city, not daring to sail back illagally.

We will get a hint to the eggs purpouse during Easter.
