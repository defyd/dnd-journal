# STUFF TODO IN THE NOTES

- [x] [[Session notes; 1|Session 1]]: specify why we didn't pay harbour fine, and that we didn't actually steal the boat (think that says in [[Gui-Appahanchi|Gui-apa]]) as well. 
- [x] ^ Nobody told us about the fine, and we weren't the one steering the boat either. The people were apparentally pirates.

- [x] the [[Sunken Ship]] had been down for a few days.

- [x] clear up ending of [[Session notes; 1|Session 1]] better. We sailed away from the shipwreck towards the city, but not quite, as we can't sail straight back without getting caugt for leaving illegally.

- [x] Add the easter hint to the [[ornate chronomancy egg|egg]] page: ___Also, here's a hint: Countless are wasted but even a few can change history___

[[Session notes; 2]] begins at 35:00 in the recorded file.
