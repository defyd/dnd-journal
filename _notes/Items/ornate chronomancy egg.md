Title: Ornate Chronomancy Egg
---
A magical item we were sent to find during our very first quest.
It's an ornate egg that we could detect had Chronomancy magic radiating from it.
It's gold, but hollow (not as heavy as if you had a slab of gold). Around it there are these slightly sticking out lines, and they have this sort of wave shape. It also has a ring of tiny Tensonite gems in the centre (Tensonite are really vibrant purple gems).

_This is going to be important at some point again later, I just know it._

We found it in the [[Sunken ship]], and Gywald Rockjaw wants us to give it to him, and we can keep the other loot in exchange (The Topaz gems and a magical cloak of dreams and nightmares).
