Pelican - This is officially a trade vessel owned by the [[Gui-apa]], which we may or may not be commandeering (_I don't actually know_). This is the ship we used to sail to the [[Sunken Ship|shipwreck]].
Gywald Rockjaw - bald chonky man with beard. This is the guy who sent us to the shipwreck in the first place.

We ran into some guards who started questioning what the fuck we were doing. We failed some charisma checks, and when [[Finn]] started flirting with a guard, shit went down fast. Me and [[Sage]] walked away (after some smooth talk and stealth), but [[Finn]] and [[Izel]] remained there, and end up having to bribe the guards (_[[Finn]] ended up giving them his entire purse, 20GP!_)

We illegally set off from the harbour, and as we got out of the city we could hear the alarm bell tolling, meaning someone certainly noticed our unregistered departure.

Our objective turns out to be diving and picking up a big man-made [[Ornate Chronomancy Egg]]. Thankfully, Mr Rockjaw has magical breathing devices for all of us, with enough oxygen to last 30 mins.

Once we got down, we found the [[Sunken Ship]], and it seemed to have been broken in half by something... (_I may or may not have zoned out a bit here, so I missed some lore D:_ )
We found the corpse of a Triton lookin' fella (confirmed by [[Sage]] to be a marrow), who had a spear. His blood had been sucked by ~~something~~ a [[Ixitxachitl]] (or demon ray)? A civilized manta, and some of them can suck blood.

[[Anne]] finds a cool cloak inside the Ship (that seems to be magical), _we later find out that this is a magical cloak of loreeeee (whoever wears it can get dreams / nightmares with premonitions)_

[[Finn]] and [[Izel]] both take a look around, and find a secret compartment where a box with 3? Topaz gems are stored. *[[Finn]] later takes a look at theese, and appraises their value.*


A big shadow thingy, that probably is a red eel, is swimming around above us (Once again [[Sage]] is the one to confirm this).

I use locate object to find the [[Ornate Chronomancy Egg]] that seems to be hidden about 80ft away from the ship, to the North, and after some frantic hand gesturing I begin leading the rest of the party that way.

We find a sinkhole that may or may not lead down to the [[Ornate Chronomancy Egg|egg]], and after some deliberation I decide to go into the sinkhole. [[Finn]] joins me since he can communicate with the others.

The hole we enter into is essentially a big maze (just like the ones the [[Ixitxachitl]] make as their living spaces). As we round a corner, I almost get stabbed by a [[Ixitxachitl|manta]], but I manage to dodge it, and combat ensues. Thankfully, [[Finn]] quickly sleeps it, and we continue on. (we've been underwater for about 14-18 minutes so far)

Eventually we emerge into a big cavern (40ft x 40ft) with 8 [[Ixitxachitl|mantas]] (three of which are the dark blood sucking variety).

The rest of the party decides to come down to us, and as he passes the sleeping manta from earlier, [[Izel]] decides to stab and kill it.

Our plan was originally for [[Izel]] to yeet the [[Ornate Chronomancy Egg|egg]] telepathically towards me, and for me to book it there and back, but as I try to get closer to it one of the mantas sense me, and trigger the alarm, so that's no longer happening.

_\*Combat begins\*_
[[Sage]] gets sucked off by the bloodsucking [[Ixitxachitl]].
I disengage from the mantas who have coalesced around me, and I run to the opposite side of the room with the [[Ornate Chronomancy Egg|egg]]. [[Izel]] then pulls me 5 ft closer to the exit.
I get attacked by every enemy multiple times and eventually get downed.
_\*Combat ends\*_

We managed to flee out of the maze, and take the "dykarklocka" back up to the surface. As we were slowly going up, two of the white [[Ixitxachitl]] came towards us, but [[Finn]] slept them both, and we got back up safely.

Once I get to the boat, I flip over the edge, and fall asleep, the [[Ornate Chronomancy Egg|egg]] still clutched in my arms.
The captain now kind of wants to extort us, take the [[Ornate Chronomancy Egg|egg]], and leave the rest of the loot for us (_and we have thoughts about mutiny to keep all of it_).

I get a sprained ankle due to my damages, which gives me -5ft of speed for 5 days, or until I heal it magically.

The topaz gems we found are worth between 600gp and 1000gp.

***LEVEL UP!***
