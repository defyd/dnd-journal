Other players; Angela: [[Sage]] Cornelia: [[Finn]] Sebastian: [[Izel]] Ellen: [[Anne]]

Pelican - officially a trade vessel. Our sailing ship to the shipwreck formerly owned by the [[Gui-apa]]
Gywald Rockjaw - bald chonky man with beard. Guy who sent us to the shipwreck in the first place

We ran into some guards, they started questioning what the fuck we were doing, we failed some charisma checks, and when [[Finn]] started flirting with a guard shit went down fast. Me and [[Sage]] walked away, but [[Finn]] and [[Izel]] stay, and end up having to bribe the guards

We left illegally from the harbour, which the people at the harbour noticed.

Going to dive and pick up a big man-made [[ornate chronomancy egg]]. We're doing this with a magical breathing device.

We found the [[Sunken ship]], and it seemed to have been broken in half.
Found corpse of Triton lookin' fella (A Merrow) who had a spear.
Got blood sucked by ~~something~~ a [[Ixitxachitl]]? (demon rays) A civilized manta that sometimes can suck blood.

[[Anne]] finds a cool cloak inside the Ship (that seems to be magical)

A big shadow thingy, that's probably a red eel, is swimming around above us

Use locate object to find the [[ornate chronomancy egg]] that seems to be hidden about 80ft away from the ship, to the North.

We find a sinkhole that may or may not lead down to the [[ornate chronomancy egg]].

I decide to go into the sinkhole, and [[Finn]] joins me since he can communicate with the others. This is essentially a maze

I almost get stabbed by an [[Ixitxachitl]] (manta), but I manage to dodge it, and combat ensues. [[Finn]] sleeps it. (we've been down for 14-18 mins so far)

We eventually emerge into a big cavern (40ft x 40ft) with 8 mantas (three of them dark).

[[Izel]] decides to stab and kill the sleeping manta from earlier

I tried to get closer to the [[ornate chronomancy egg]] to joink it, but the mantas found me, and triggered the alarm.

Our plan was originally for [[Izel]] to yeet the [[ornate chronomancy egg]] telepathically towards me, and for me to book it there and back, but that's no longer happening.

_\*Combat begins\*_
[[Sage]] gets sucked off by the bloodsucking [[Ixitxachitl]].
I disengage from the mantas who have coalesced around me, and I run to the opposite side of the room with the [[ornate chronomancy egg]]. [[Izel]] then pulls me 5 ft closer to the exit.
I get attacked by every enemy multiple times and eventually get downed.
_\*Combat ends\*_

We managed to flee out of the maze, and take the "dykarklocka" back. As we were slowly going up, two of the white [[Ixitxachitl]] came towards us, but [[Finn]] slept them both, and we got back up safely.

Once I get to the boat, I flopped over the edge, and fell asleep.
The captain now kind of wants to extort us, take the [[ornate chronomancy egg]], and leave the rest of the loot for us.

I get a sprained ankle, which gives me -5ft of speed for 5 days, or until I heal it magically.

The topaz gems we found are worth between 600gp and 1000gp.

***LEVEL UP!***
