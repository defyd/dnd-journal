> Quick notice;
> I wasn't actually present for this session, so I might not be able to provide quite as much detail as last time. Hopefully at least some of this is interesting though! (I got the entire session recorded, so everything should still be accurate).

As we sail back towards land dawn is breaking. Thankfully we prepared well, and when we woke up in the middle of the night we did so after having gotten adquate amounts of sleep. *yayyy*

[[Gywald Rockjaw|Gywald]] gives us a map of the coast surrounding [[Sun's Rest]], and it has a route marked that we can take to get safely back to the city.

We decide that taking the [[ornate chronomancy egg|egg]] probably is a very bad idea, as we're too beat up to put up a fight. We could just take it and run once we get to shore, but that also seems kind of dumb, as it's hard to outrun bullets. [[Anne]] comes up with a master plan where we make an illusion of throwing it overboard, into the water (by "misstake"), and then running away with the real one as the crew is searching for the illusion. Sadly the party doesn't seem convinced that this is a good idea.

Anne decides to have a closer look at the [[ornate chronomancy egg|egg]], and discovers that it not only ticks and tocks if you listen closely, the upper golden trim of it can be twisted up to 180 degres in either direction, and when that is done the ticking changes pace and becomes more intensive _(a nat 1 perception check doesn't differentiate the ticking no matter what direction it is turned)_.

Last session we found out that [[Gywald Rockjaw|Gywald]] is being payed quite a lot for the delivery _maybe it's the [[Gui-Appahanchi|Gui-Apa]]? The ship was originally theirs?_. To see if they can get some more info [[Sage]] asks one of the drunken deck hands if he knows who contacted [[Gywald Rockjaw|Gywald]] about retrieving this [[ornate chronomancy egg|egg]], but we don't get a lot of useful information out of him. Apparentally the pirates went and retrieved a sculpture of an owl last month.

[[Sage]] attempts to pull a sneaky and jumps off the ship so they can fly back to the rear window of the captain's cabin, aaaand... As they're running to jump of the side they trip, knock over a barrel on deck, and the entire crew turns and get to see [[Sage]] just yeet themselves off the ship and take flight. [[Gywald Rockjaw|Gywald]] shouts out to them and asks them what they're doing, and [[Sage]] just decides to make it look like they wanted to stretch their wings a little, so they go fly around the ship for a while. They fly around for a few minutes before landing in the top of the mast, and contemplating their actions.

We arrive at shore, and it turns out that we're being dumped on [[Serpent's Coast]]. As stated earlier we get a hand drawn (but good enough) map so that we can get back through the jungle, and we also get a warning that [[Serpent's Coast]] isn't just a fancy name, there are snakes there.
[[Anne]] reluctantly hands the egg over to [[Gywald Rockjaw|Gywald]], and the pirates sail off into the rising sun, leaving us alone on the sandy riverbank.

Immediately once we're alone [[Anne]] pulls out a trumpet and begins playng what sounds like a national anthem (pretty decently actually), and soon after [[Finn]] and [[Izel]] start bickering about if we should keep the Topaz gems, or if we should find the owner of the [[Sunken ship|shipwreck]] and return them. They eventually decide that giving the topaz gems back would be resonable, but the rest of the party should get compensation in that case. *[[Finn]] is too righeous for theived goods xD*.
The rest of the party doesn't like the sound of giving back the only reward they got after such a dangerous mission.
[[Izel]] argues that since the owner of the [[Sunken ship|boat]] probably had it insured, they would probably pay a handsome reward if we return their gems to them. Which then leads onto him just thinking we could keep them. [[Finn]] still wants to give them back though.
The party decides to talk about it later though.
