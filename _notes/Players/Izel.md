##### Important Info

##### Rumours
- Izel was caught cheating a captain in a rather high stakes card game down at the Hound’s Pit in the harbor. She still claims innocence, but she’s still banned from playing there again…
- Izel was seen with the Starfall Foundation when they helped evacuate workers from a catastrophe in a Firestone workshop. Noticeably, she saved the foreman from falling into a raging chemical fire.
- Someone witnessed Izel and another Starfall Foundation Overseer entering an objecting merchant's house. Minutes later, a shriek of terror echoed across the street, and then Izel and the other member left carrying a small coffer.
