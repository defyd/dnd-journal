##### Important Info
Nocturnal, as the moth families are usually up during night.
(the butterfly families, however, are up during the day)
The monarch butterflies are travelling bards almost, maybe an interesting race for a backup character?

##### Rumours
- Rumour says that Antennae is a recovering coffee addict due to her constant yawns and tired demeanour.
- According to rumour, Antennae contracted asthma from her childhood of growing up and working in a coal mine. _This seems true so far_
- Eye witness reports say that Antennae will put things on fire once she gets too excited.
