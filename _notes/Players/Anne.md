![[Pasted image 20220327154256.png]]

#### Description:
Moth person, four arms and wings.

##### Important Info:
Nocturnal, as the moth families are usually up during night.
(the butterfly families, however, are up during the day)
_The monarch butterflies are travelling bards almost, maybe an interesting race for a backup character?_

##### Rumours:
- Rumour says that Antennae is a recovering coffee addict due to her constant yawns and tired demeanour.
- According to rumour, Antennae contracted asthma from her childhood of growing up and working in a coal mine. _This seems true so far_
- Eye witness reports say that Antennae will put things on fire once she gets too excited.
