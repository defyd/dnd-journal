# Sage (Angela)
![[Pasted image 20220327154313.png]]

#### Description:
Sage has medium-short, black hair with two longer hair streaks on the sides, and prominent yellow eyes. Their feet and lower legs are formed like a bird’s. On their back, they have a pair of black wings. They wear fairly simple clothing; a dark top with an open back to make way for the wings, a handmade and embroidered cloak with flaps at the back to also make space for the wings. No shoes. The odd thing in their clothing that sticks out is the black, leather gloves.


##### Important Info:


##### Rumours:
- Sage is rumoured to be a low-ranking member of a criminal gang, which holds no name but the members all wear some form of bird mask. The group is nicknamed “Murder of Crows” for their clean work with assassinations.
- Sage is rumoured to have got on the wrong side with a forest witch. The witch was angered by something they had done and had attempted to turn them into a crow, but the spell failed. Now Sage looks like a human freak with wings, legs and talons of a bird. _True? Maybe? It probably doesn't have anything to do with a witch, though._
- Sage was an apprentice at Last Journey, which is rumoured to be run by a group of criminals. To dispose of “evidence”, they would use the mortuary services to bury any trail of their work.
