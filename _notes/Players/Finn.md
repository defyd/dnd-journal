#### Description:
Gay wizard with the sex drive of a bard
Noble
a gem dragonborn (topaz I think it was. He's yellow / golden)
Finnlaugur Brestir Ylur Grímólfursson is a well-built topaz gem dragonborn that stands proud at 6.4 feet (195 cm) tall. His horns, as on most gem-dragons, are sort of broken off and floating freely above his head, still keeping their shape. On one of his horns there’s a wide ring with small pearls, and on another one there’s a normal, simple ring in a green-turquoise colour. His light-blue eyes shine with curiosity and kindness as he looks around. As for clothes, he’s not wearing too much. His waist, from just under his chest to his hips, is wrapped in a blue fabric. At his hips hangs the loincloth that ends just below his knees, in a slightly darker colour. On his shoulders hangs a fairly simple and arm-less wizard's robe, this one also in a deep-blue colour. It goes all the way to the ground in length. Around his neck there’s also a long necklace with an amulet, and in the middle of that amulet there’s a shining crystal (his arcane focus). On one of his arms he carries an intricate, broad bracelet, this one with a gem in the centre; his signet “ring”.

#### Rumours:
- Was once seen entering a brothel, only to leave the next day. Probably not voluntarily, as the manager was screaming after him.
- He once donated a large sum of money to aid a barkeep in saving his bar, in which he now has an honorary table, and a private room at his disposal. _This seems like it could be true_
- He’s often credited by strangers for the heroic act of saving a class of first-graders from a burning building that they were trapped in.
