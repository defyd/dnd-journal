Sentient manta rays
Live in caves and have priests that make the caves
Some of them are vampiric, and suck people's blood

They seem to echo locate.
There are white ones and dark ones with some red symbol pulsing on their chest (lung shaped almost)

Can't survive with too low water pressure

Dark ones are the bloodsucking ones
