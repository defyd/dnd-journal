Title: New Eagle
---
#### Info / goals:
The second-biggest organization (after [[Gui-Appahanchi|Gui-Apa]]).

#### History:
New Eagle is a coalition of newer families who claim that the iron grip of [[Gui-Appahanchi|Gui-Apa]] is choking out invention, progress and keeping the less fortunate in monotone 15 hour workdays where ambition goes to die, and the workers follow soon after. Their main gripes are that power has been too concentrated, and away from themselves, that workdays should be limited to 11 hours a day in order for anyone to be able to cultivate their own ambitions and not be creatively bound to their work for their entire lives.
