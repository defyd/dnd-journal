A rebellion force intent on usurping the gods themselves.

#### History:
Broken gate is a rebellion force. They rose up against the city of [[Masnal]] proposing pledging to not switch work for ten years after employment. What started as a movement for those who thought [[New Eagle]] didnâ€™t take things far enough, it escalated into almost a cult intent on storming the celestial abode and usurping the gods themselves to abolish this cruel system that encourages exploiting everyone and everything for personal gain.
