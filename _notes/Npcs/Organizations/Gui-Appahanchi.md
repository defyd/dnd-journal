Title: Gui-Appahanchi
---
_(Gui-Apa for short)_

#### Info / goals:
The biggest organization in [[Maschiz]], who basically have a say in everything	

#### History:
The Gui-Appahanchi is a fusion of the two oldest and most influential families on the island, and they have a say in almost everything. The current heads of these families, Akha Gui and Grand Guardian Izel Appahanchi have been around for close to half a millennia yet little is known about them, and the extent of their power is unknown. While there is no doubt that they hold immense sway over the future of [[Maschiz]], some claim that they have a part in every business, every transaction on the entire island. There are jokes that theyâ€™ve employed the gods themselves, although that would of course be ridiculous...

#### Important people in the organization:
* Akha Gui & Grand Guardian Izel Appahanchi - Current heads of the 2 families, and leaders of the organization.

#### Things they have done:
* 

#### Things we have done with them:
* The pirate ship we sailed on in [[Session notes; 1|Session 1]] was officially still theirs, so the pirates probably stole it or otherwise got it from them somehow.
